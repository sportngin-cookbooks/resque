# /etc/init/resque-scheduler-manager.conf - manage a set of resques

# This example config should work with Ubuntu 12.04+.  It
# allows you to manage multiple resque instances with
# Upstart, Ubuntu's native service management tool.
#
# See resque.conf for how to manage a single resque instance.
#
# Use "stop resque-scheduler-manager" to stop all resque instances.
# Use "start resque-scheduler-manager" to start all instances.
# Use "restart resque-scheduler-manager" to restart all instances.
# Crazy, right?
